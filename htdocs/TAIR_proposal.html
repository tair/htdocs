<H3>PROJECT SUMMARY</H3>

We propose to develop a new database, designated TAIR, that will provide public electronic access to all public information pertaining to, and derived from, the Arabidopsis genome project.   The goal of the project is to facilitate utilization by the scientific community of  the genomic resources available in Arabidopsis. The design anticipates the completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence, widespread use of high density DNA microarrays for studies of gene expression and other emerging genetic technologies.  In addition, relevant information from the approximately 9000 papers published on Arabidopsis will be entered into the database and associated with genome-related information. Because of the importance of Arabidopsis as a model for all higher plants, a fundamental design feature of TAIR will be ease of access by scientists who do not have a primary research interest in Arabidopsis.  For similar reasons, the database design and implementation will attempt to maximize communication of TAIR with other databases.  The database will be managed as a public resource by an executive committee with representatives from four institutions.

<P><A name ="ltv"><B>LONG TERM VISION</B></a> <A href ="#top">Go to top</a>

<P>Scientists studying plant biology are currently enjoying a golden age of discovery in which formerly intractable problems are being solved on a daily basis.  Thousands of biologists around the world have adopted Arabidopsis as a model for studies of all aspects of plant biology (Meinke <I>et al.</I>, 1998; Meyerowitz and Somerville, 1994). The collective genius of such a large number of scientists studying a single plant species is, by itself, a qualitatively different force in science and much of the recent surge in discovery is simply due to this effect. It is expected that by the end of the year 2000 the complete sequence of the Arabidopsis genome will be determined. Within a few years, we will also know where and when each gene is expressed (at the tissue level of resolution) and what the consequences are of increasing or decreasing the expression of any gene. </P>
<P>The completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence will be followed by an effort to fully sequence the rice genome and all the needs and opportunities expressed herein for Arabidopsis will eventually apply to rice. In addition, large numbers of EST sequences will soon be available for representatives of most or all of the economically important plant species. These sequences will provide direct links between the biology of the fully sequenced plants and the EST-rich species. Thus, the information derived from basic studies of gene function in Arabidopsis or other plants will be rapidly adapted to interrogate and understand the comparable processes in most or all of the economically important plant species. Therefore, there is a need for an Arabidopsis database to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of both the Arabidopsis and rice genome. Ideally, it may also serve as a model for the development of similar databases for other plants.  This database should be not only a repository for all Arabidopsis data, but also a source of value-added and integrated information, which can be easily used by all plant biologists. The immediate needs of the plant community for such a database are summarized in the proceedings of two workshops: <a href="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/db/dallas.report.html">Report of the Ad Hoc Committee </A> and <a href="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/db/database.needs.html"> Database Needs </a>. 

<P><A name ="cgr"><B>CURRENT GENOME RESEARCH</a></B> <A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>The Arabidopsis genome contains approximately 23,000 genes (Bevan <I>et al.</I>, 1998). During the next several years, the sequence of the Arabidopsis genome will be completed and extensive sequence information will become available for many other plant species of economic importance (Pennisi 1998). Most or all of the Arabidopsis genes will be used to develop gene chips or microarrays that permit simultaneous measurements of the expression (mRNA levels) of all of the genes (Kehoe <I>et al.</I>, 1999; Ruan <I>et al.</I>, 1998). These will be used to generate information about the expression of all the genes in the organism in response to a wide variety of treatments and genetic backgrounds. These experiments will lay the foundation for understanding which genes are in common regulatory networks (i.e., regulons) and what factors regulate the regulons. Although the experiments are straightforward, the data analysis is rather complex and much of the data produced by these experiments will be lost unless suitable database structures are developed in the near future.</P>
<P>Advances in genomics will be accompanied by increased interest in genetic approaches to problems in plant biology. Comprehensive libraries of insertional mutations will permit the isolation, by reverse genetics, of null mutations in all Arabidopsis genes. Thus, phenotypic information will accrue for all Arabidopsis genes. Extensive collections of enhancer-trap or promoter-trap lines are being developed that permit sensitive analyses of the spatial patterns of gene expression down to the single-cell level (Martienssen, 1998). Thousands of new classes of mutants will be isolated by selecting for suppressors or enhancers of existing mutations. In contrast to the current use of insertional mutagenesis, the genes corresponding to enhancers and suppressors will be cloned by very high resolution mapping of the mutations. Thus, a limited number of candidate genes which are evident in the delimited region of genomic sequence can be directly tested for complementation. This will depend on the development of very high resolution maps. Work is underway to produce such a map by sequencing &gt;3000 random fragments of a race of <I>Arabidopsis </I>that is polymorphic to the race being fully sequenced  (Cho <I>et al.</I>, in press). Thus, when the complete sequence is available, there will be at least 3000 precisely mapped polymorphisms associated with the sequence based map.  The completion of this map will obviate many of the current concerns of the community about genetic maps. </P>
<P>Extensive genomic-based work in other plant species will produce a flood of sequence information. In addition, high resolution proteomics research will become important.  For  example, this is a likely approach for identifying the substrates of &gt;1000 kinase genes that form many of the regulatory networks in Arabidopsis. Thus, we are entering an era of explosive growth of knowledge about Arabidopsis in particular, and plants in general.  Most of the data generated by the projects described above will NEVER appear in printed journals and will only be available to the community through electronic databases.

<P><A name ="nnpd"><B>THE NEED FOR A NEW PLANT DATABASE (TAIR)</B></a> <A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>Because Arabidopsis is one of the most intensively studied organisms, and is a direct model for the 250,000 other species of plants, it is appropriate to undertake a major investment in developing new information representation, storage, and retrieval tools for Arabidopsis in particular and plants in general. We propose to develop a comprehensive genome-oriented database that we tentatively designate TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource). Because the value of Arabidopsis derives from its utility in understanding other plants, our goal is to build a structure for TAIR that permits facile high resolution linking of specific information about Arabidopsis to that in all other plants (and vice versa).</P>
<P>Looking into the future more generally, it is apparent that scientific publishing is undergoing a much-needed revolution. All of the major journals will be electronic within a few years, and as that transition occurs, scientists will develop new tools for interacting with data. The complexity of biological knowledge in many fields requires new mechanisms for integrating data. Proliferation of review journals is an indication of the need, but is not a satisfactory </P>
<P>solution to the problem. Rather, we envision that a new format for knowledge and information retrieval will evolve. The development of computer programs that draw genetic and physical maps "on the fly" from currently available data, rather than storing static drawings, is an early example of what will become a more general mechanism for integrating data (<a href = "http://genome-www3.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/chromosomes/">http://genome-www3.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/chromosomes/</a>). Another example is integrated, graphical representations of gene expression in individual cells of three-dimensional models of organisms at various developmental stages (<a href = "http://www.ribs.ucla.edu/~volkerh/3dembryo/">http://www.ribs.ucla.edu/~volkerh/3dembryo/</a>). With such a model it will be possible to find relationships between objects (e.g., genes) and processes that would be difficult or impossible with current information retrieval technologies. This difficulty will become more profound as we move from "one-gene genetics", in which genes are studied in relative isolation, toward multi-locus genetics in which the effects of genes are studied in complex genetic backgrounds. Similarly, as the regulatory networks that control all cellular events are elucidated, it will be difficult or impossible to understand the connections between different regulatory circuits without mechanisms for integrating knowledge and information into a holistic form. Ultimately, a database of the kind that we envision will provide the common vocabulary, visualization tools, and information retrieval mechanisms that permit integration of all knowledge about an organism into a seamless whole that can be queried from any perspective. Of equal importance for plant biologists, an ideal TAIR will permit a user to use information about one organism to develop hypotheses about less well-studied organisms. This is important because it is unrealistic to expect someone working on a plant such as wheat or poplar to know the intimate details about the latest results with Arabidopsis or maize. Thus, our goal, shared by others (Gelbart 1998), is to develop facile tools that permit an individual working outside the model species to formulate a query based on the organism of interest, have that query directed to the relevant knowledge for the plant models, and present the information about the models in a way that can be understood by the plant biology community at large. 

<P><A name ="dadm"><B>DESIGN OF TAIR'S DATA MODEL</B></a> <A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>The logic of the design of the database structure emphasizes seamless integration of data that are attributable to their original sources. A conceptual database model for TAIR is represented in Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams (Booch <I>et al.</I>, 1998) (Figures 1 to 4). UML is becoming the standard representation for object-oriented designs, providing a description of the data structure that is relatively intuitive. The most important aspects of our diagrams are the data types and the relationships between them. An arrow represents an inheritance relationship, with the arrow drawn from the subtype to the supertype. A simple line between two types indicates a direct association between the two, with the relationships indicated on either side of the relationship; for example, 1..* --- 0..* means that an instance of the first type may have any number of associations with instances of the second type, while an instance of the second type will always be associated with at least one instance of the first type. It should be noted that many of the relationships are loosely constrained by the model. The true constraints can be over and above what appears in the model and will be implemented in the physical database schema. We plan to develop and implement the physical ER (Entity-Relationship) schema of the database from the UML diagram. We will use an industry-standard relational database (<a href = "http://www.sybase.com/">Sybase</a>) as the database management system (DBMS) and an object-oriented application server for coupling object-oriented applications to the relational DBMS (see Section <A href ="#dws">DATA WAREHOUSE STRUCTURE</a>). </P>
<P>In the conceptual database model, integration of data will be achieved in several ways:

<P><A name ="gdi"><B>General data integration</B></a>  <A href ="#top">Go to top </a> 
<P>Every datum will be derived from TAIR_Object, the root of the class hierarchy. This root object provides universal functionality such as links to one or more references, which can be a journal article, link to an external database, personal communications, or an analysis program Figure 1. This attribution will not only provide the integrity of the data, but also serve as a bridge of communication among researchers. Besides the required attribution, an TAIR_Object can be associated with entities such as keyword, </P>
<P>synonym, comment, image, experiment and model. Our definition of a model is any graphical description (hypothetical or experimental) of relationships among TAIR_Objects. Examples would include the ABC model of floral organ development and the gibberillic acid biosynthetic pathway

<P>Figure 1 A DB model relating general information and their attribution </I>(ATHENA=TAIR)
<P><A name ="imp"><B>Integration of map data</B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>Map data will be integrated by the concept of mappable elements (ME) (Figure 2). We define a mappable element to be any object that may have a position (assignment) on one or more maps of various types. An assignment positions an ME on a map by coordinants that can be either absolute or relative to left and right neighbors. For example, a genetic locus has an assignment on a genetic map, which is derived from its primary linkage data to two adjacent loci (coordinates). An assignment can have multiple coordinants, providing for flexibility in the way mapped elements are placed on maps. For example, segments and points can be mapped, and positions can be either absolute, or relative to other assignments. Also, mapping with respect to left and right coordinates allows for greater flexibility in updating map information and allows more accurate representation of MEs that can only be mapped as a range (e.g. genetic loci). In our model, maps are derived from MEs and thus maps can be positioned relative to other maps. The relationship among maps, MEs, and assignments permits placement of any ME on any map. For example, one can place a gene on a genetic map, physical map, a sequence, and/or a DNA segment. 

<P><a href="/images/Map_1.gif"><IMG SRC="/images/Map_1.gif"  WIDTH=269 HEIGHT=206></a></a>
<P>Figure 2 A conceptual DB model relating maps and mappable elements

<P><A name ="isd"><B>Integration of sequence data</B></I></a> <A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P>
Our system integrates sequences and maps by modeling a sequence as a type of map, and therefore also a mappable element (Figure 2). This unification is important for an organism whose genome will soon be completely sequenced. Genes will themselves be kinds of maps onto which are mapped features such as promoters, introns, and exons. Likewise, proteins are maps with protein-specific features such as functional motifs. Sequence is further specialized as DNA, amino acid, and RNA sequences, and can be associated with a homology set. In our model, the homology set includes sequences from Arabidopsis as well as other organisms, which show significant overall similarity (as defined by a set of similarity scores such as BLAST's P-value and high score) to a specific region of the Arabidopsis genome. Homology sets will be stored and updated such that they accumulate information both across species and for gene families. DNA sequence will exist both as a feature of DNA segments and as a virtual, contiguous sequence. Annotation of the sequence will be carried out on the contigous sequence and annotations will become mappable elements of the sequence map.

<P><A name ="ipd"><B>Integration of phenotype data</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a> 
<P> Phenotypic and genotypic data will be integrated by association with a common line, which are distal elements of a hierarchy of TaxonNodes (Figure 3). In our model, TaxonNode represents a taxonomic hierarchy of plants from which lines, ecotypes, and species, among other entities, are derived. TaxonNode is associated to itself, which allows representation of a variety of hierarchical taxonomic groups. A phenotype is described as an association between phenotypic trait and trait value. Phenotypic trait is derived from an experiment that is composed of the assay type and experimental variables (see Figure 4). These include anatomy (anatomical parts and developmental stages) and environmental conditions/treatment. Trait values can be either qualitative (e.g. short, white) or quantitative (e.g. 50-100 seeds/silique, 10-15 cm). For example, dwarf will be translated in the database as shoot (anatomy), height (trait), short (value) (in this case, the assay type of the experiment may be naked eye observation); embryo lethal will be embryo (anatomy), viability (trait), dead (value); and powdery mildew resistant will be powdery mildew (treatment), responsiveness (trait), resistance score 1-5 (value).

<P>Figure 3 A. Conceptual DB model relating taxonomic and phenotypic information</P>


<P><A name ="iep"><B>Integration of expression and protein localization data</B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>TAIR will be designed to contain the expression profiles of transcripts from various assay types (e.g. microarrays, northern blots, in situ hybridizations, and promoter-reporter constructs). Each transcript has a pattern of expression that can be inferred from raw data (Figure 4). Each raw data point is derived from experimental variables (external or genetic environments, treatments, anatomical parts and developmental stages), assay types, and probes (DNASegment). Experiment is a superclass of many different types of experiments including expression and protein localization experiments (Figure 4). A goal of TAIR is to integrate information across older experimental technologies such as northern blot and in situ hybridization data taken from the literature with newer methods, such as gene chip and microarray experiments, which will come into the database in bulk. Currently database structures and analysis software for microarray data are under development in various facets of biology <a href="http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/DIR/LCG/15K/HTML/">(http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/DIR/LCG/15K/HTML/)</A>. We will revise our current, general model of expression data as the standards of high thorough-put expression research stabilize.

<P><A name ="ibd"><b>Integration of biological data</B></I></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>A long-term goal of the TAIR project is to facilitate the understanding of how Arabidopsis functions. A step towards this is to define the functions of all gene products in Arabidopsis. Genomic and proteomic studies will facilitate and accelerate this process. However, we need to be able to integrate other biological data such as physiological, ecological, biochemical, and structural (PEBS), which will not only help assign functions to unknown genes along with genomic studies such as systematic knock-out studies and microarray expression studies. We propose to curate articles from scientific journals to include PEBS data as well as molecular and genetic data. In addition, we propose that TAIR will also contain direct links to a major account of the biology of Arabidopsis, which is found in the forthcoming web version of "Arabidopsis" (Meyerowitz and Somerville 1994). The text will form a corpus for integrating PEBS in TAIR. We envision that a user seeking PEBS information would begin at a page with some predefined options and a search option of defined vocabulary.</P>
<P>As knowledge about Arabidopsis and other plants expands, this kind of ready access to information will permit researchers to ask "what if" questions - to surf the web of knowledge in a manner of speaking, in search of connections between processes and concepts. Indeed, it is possible to imagine that as information continues to accrue, the identification of a poorly populated field or domain, or areas of inconsistencies between species, may be the stimulus for a new investigation. This level of information would be prohibitively expensive to acquire by standard curation. But if we can obtain cooperation from the most important journals we can accomplish this level of information retrieval by author-mediated entry into defined vocabulary on-line forms similar to those used by GenBank. 

<P><A name ="dcv"><B>Development of controlled vocabulary</B></a> <P>Development and implementation of controlled vocabulary will play a pivotal role in advancing genomic research. It will be essential in: (i) integrating the different types of data described previously; (ii) facilitating the communication among users; and (iii) enabling them to apply more sophisticated queries into TAIR. There is a movement to standardize controlled vocabulary for function, process, and subcellular location of gene products among three organismal databases, SGD (yeast), FLYBASE (Drosophila), and MGD (mouse), termed the <A href ="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~ashburn/GO/">GO</a> (Gene Ontology) database. We propose to adhere to their standards where appropriate and develop controlled vocabulary for describing the function, process, and localization (i.e. developmental stages, anatomical parts, and subcellular location) of gene products that apply to higher plants. We also propose to develop a system of translating phenotypic descriptions using controlled vocabulary from the currently available descriptions of lines at <a href="http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/">AIMS</a> and <a href="http://nasc.nott.ac.uk/">NASC</a> stock centers. TAIR's controlled vocabulary will be constructed in consultation with experts in the appropriate field. Once a version is constructed, we will send it out to our advisory board for review, then to the Arabidopsis newsgroup for further input. We will post the revised versions of the controlled vocabulary to the Arabidopsis newsgroup as well as publish in a major plant journal. 

<P><A name ="ddi"><B>DESIGN OF DATABASE INTERFACE</B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>Web browsers will be the common route of data access for most users. TAIR's interfaces will be designed to maximize integration of various data and interactivity between the user and the database, to allow the user to define what and how to obtain relevant data. Various querying and browsing methods will be provided both for Arabidopsis experts and biologists from farther afield. We will provide several types of querying methods: </P>
<I><P>1. Simple text searching</I>. This will allow users to type in any word and search any field(s) provided as pop-up menus. (e.g., the <a href = "http://www.ncgr.org/gsdb/maestro/index.html"> Maestro interface to GSDB</a>.)</P><I><P>2. Complex, form-based searching</I>. This will allow users to query using multiple criteria using web forms. These will be divided into major sections on a biological basis and will include genes, proteins, polymorphisms, phenotypes, and maps. </P>
<I><P>3. Facilitated, ad hoc searching</I>. This will allow users to formulate a query across fields and tables. This search will be facilitated by a semi-automated query-building interface that will prompt with appropriate possible field names and pop-up menus for controlled vocabulary.</P>
<I><P>4. Structured Query Language (SQL)</I>. This is the most advanced and most flexible querying option (see <A href ="#dac">Direct Access</a> for more detail). An example is the <a href = "http://www.ncgr.org/gsdb/adhoc/info.html">SQL interface to GSDB</a>.
<P>We will make querying as interactive as possible and will include set operations (ability to perform a subsequent query on previous query results), datatype conversion (e.g. DNA to amino acid sequence), and context sensitive searchin
<P>In addition to querying methods, we will provide textual and graphical browsing facilities. Browsing differs from querying by showing a substantial amount of data into which the user can dig deeper. This helps users who can't describe what they are looking for, but who would know it if they saw it. One danger of browsing is drowning the user in too much data, such as a list of all genes in Arabidopsis. This will be avoided by mechanisms that control the level of detail revealed.
<P>Graphical browsing, when appropriate, can better harness the processing power of both computer and human. Biological data that we plan to present visually include genomic maps, features of genes, tissue-specific gene expression, and plots of expression data. Visual display of data will be complemented with more traditional textual pages that focus on clusters of related elements of the data model, with appropriate links out to other parts of the model. For example, a gene will be described in a similar to the current (AtDB)<a href="/search"> locus</a> pages , but containing features of the <a href="http://genome-www3.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/chromosomes/">Genetic and physical map displays</a>. Other pages may present tables of elements where the data density is lower, such as lists of expression experiments organized by tissue or treatment, with clickable links to the results of each one.
<P>In the following, we describe a few examples of graphical browsing and querying functions relating to map and expression data that we plan to implement:

<P><A name ="gpm"><b>Genetic and physical map displays</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>  
<p>Data integration will be focused on forward and reverse genetics to relate gene annotation of the sequence to mutant phenotypes and vice versa. For example, functions of genes from sequence annotation and experimental data will be related to map positions and phenotypes of mutant alleles. This will involve integration of physical and genetic maps. Currently the map position of mutant alleles suffers from genetic maps of variable confidence due to differences in the quality and quantity of primary map data. We propose to provide three levels of resolution in integrating genetic and physical map information. First, we will display the different genetic (e.g. RI and Classical/Genetic) and physical maps with links to common entities such as PCR-based markers and cloned genes. This will allow users to browse a region at a relatively low resolution, but allow them to find markers to refine their region of interest. Second, we will provide a definitive integration of physical and genetic maps, which is the sequenced genome aligned with polymorphisms including the many thousands of CAPS, SNP, and SSLP markers, and simple sequence repeats. This will allow users to define markers to use for mapping new mutant alleles relative to the sequence information to facilitate map based cloning. In addition, the sequence map will include positions of T-DNA insertions and other aberrations from systematic gene knock-out studies, which will be the most comprehensive collection of null allele information. Third, we will provide graphically genetic map information of a given region defined by the user, with, wherever possible, map positions computed from the primary map data. The output will provide all the different genetic maps in the region with error bars to indicate the confidence level. This will allow the users to interpret the most relevant map positions of mutant alleles and relate them to the physical maps in the most logical manner. We will provide a graphic interface that progressively reveals all the map information in a series of view levels from the whole chromosome to the sequence with all the mappable entities, e.g. markers, genetic loci, clones, ORFs, gene features (exon, intron, etc.), and sequence features (polymorphisms, repeats, T-DNA insertions, etc). Each object on these maps will be hot-linked to pages describing all available information about that object.

<P><A name ="sd"><B>Sequence display</B></I></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a></P> For every region of the Arabidopsis genome it will be possible to see the corresponding sequences available for all other species. Conversely, it will be possible to begin with the sequence of any organism and go directly to the alignment with Arabidopsis. For all genes, TAIR will build and update a graphical view of the experimental data, annotated data, prediction results, and homology search results, each attributed to its source (e.g. analysis program, literature reference, or curatorial interpretation). 
<P>AtDB recently released a sequence view that shows overlap of AGI clones and other 10kb+ sequences in GenBank, together with matches to genetic markers (see <a href = "/search">Sequence Overview</a>). This display involves a combination of assembly (using scripts) and manual placement of sequences and sequenced markers. One of the tasks for TAIR will be to re-create and extend this display and to improve its automation. A good representation of the level of detail to be shown at the sequence level of the map display is conveyed by the Genotator project at <a href="http://www.fruitfly.org/~nomi/genotator/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory </a>. The integrated sequence and map visualization and query interface will be developed and deployed in the first year of funding.

<P><A name ="edd"><b>Expression data displays</B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>TAIR will provide several ways of accessing expression data. The simplest way will be directly from a gene-information page to view a plot of all expression information across all assay types and experimental variables. Another route will be through a gene chip or microarray experiment that will show differential expression across genes for two or more treatments (including control). The highest level access will be to view summaries of gene expression across multiple genes and multiple experiments. 
<P>Multi-gene expression data (whether from single or multiple experiments) will be visualized in several ways. First we will have matrices of color plots, showing differential expression relative to the control. Second, TAIR will present the results of cluster analyses showing similarity or correlation of expression patterns of genes across treatments. This may be shown either in conjunction with or independent of color plots. Third, we will present either pre-stored or dynamic multivariate statistical descriptions such as principle component analyses. Finally, we will integrate the expression levels of genes onto the physical map. This will address questions of higher-order genomic organization such as regions of higher or lower accessibility to transcription machinery. Furthermore, because gene microarrays do not require full genome sequence, this class of information will be available for many other plant species. Thus, it will be possible to start with a gene name or sequence from any species and compare how the corresponding gene in Arabidopsis or other species responds under given experimental variables. 
<P>These analyses will be aided by a hierarchical classification of gene function to aid in specifying subsets of data to visualize or compare. Therefore, genome annotation will be linked to expression data. This kind of analysis will establish functional associations between genes of unknown (or murky) function and genes of known function, thereby suggesting possible functions for the unknown genes. Microarray analysis is at an early stage of development and it will be a challenge to analyze this type of expression data in a multicellular organism. Carnegie also houses the Arabidopsis microarray project and we propose to work with them closely to integrate the microarray expression data and analysis capacities in TAIR. The expression data, visualization and query systems will be developed starting in the second year of funding.

corba<P><A name ="tsg"><b>Tissue-specific Gene Expression</B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>In order to understand multicellular development we will eventually need detailed information about the functions, associations, and relationships of gene products with respect to development. Arabidopsis is significant among genomes slated for complete sequencing as being among the few multi-cellular organisms. This biological complexity adds histology and anatomy as variables that must be addressed by a comprehensive data resource. We plan to begin exploring this dimension by integrating anatomical and tissue differentiation with the rich data on gene expression. We will initially approach this by using static two-dimensional images of anatomy and stylized tissue sections similar in style to those used by <a href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu/.bin/fbimage">FLYBASE</a>. Our images will additionally be used to query and visualize tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. Clicking on a region will give a list of all genes known to be expressed there. The intersection of this list with a specific category of gene functions could then be selected in order to find which categories of genes are expressed there.  This development will probably take place in year three, at which point client-side support of Java should be robust enough to deploy such dynamic functionality necessary to do justice to this complex form of query and display.   In the long-term, and outside the scope of the current proposal, we envision the virtual plant, which would represent the plant at all stages of development from the zygote to a mature plant in which every cell would be individually addressable. Thus, for instance, a user would query by clicking on a representation of the plant at a desired stage of development to indicate either a "whole mount" or a "section" through a particular region. Many genes could be queried simultaneously either as direct overlays or as differential representations. 

<P><A name ="lts"><b>LONG TERM SUPPORT FOR TAIR</B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>We envision that because of the changes taking place in publishing, there is an opportunity to create an TAIR that will eventually be self-supporting in the same way that journals are self supporting. As the distinction between the format blurs, the concept of paying for a database subscription will become commonplace. However, we believe five to seven years of support are necessary to develop the structure and acquire the dataset that will be adequate to become self-sustaining. We envision forming partnerships with journals in which data from the journals will be transferred to TAIR in such a way that the data is linked to the journal article. This will draw users to the electronic versions of the journals, which will in turn generate income for the journals (probably by an electronic small payments system such as Cybercash). It is also possible that a system of royalty payments may emerge for linked information retrieval services. The leading electronic publisher is Highwire Press, which was founded by the Stanford University librarians. We hope to have at least one member of Highwire Press on the advisory committee of TAIR. We envisage no charges to academic or non-profit organizations during the period covered by this grant.  We will seek corporate support for the database through donations.


<P><A name ="dws"><b>DATA WAREHOUSE STRUCTURE</B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>TAIR will be implemented in three tiers, and will make use of the National Center for Genomic Research (NCGR) Data Object Layer (Figure 5). A three-tiered architecture introduces a "middle tier", usually in the form of an application server, between client-side software and database servers. TAIR's database server will be Sybase, an industry-standard relational database. The client side of TAIR will include Web browsers and thin clients (e.g. Java applications).

<P><a href="/images/3tier2.gif"><IMG SRC="/images/3tier2.gif"  WIDTH=269 HEIGHT=206></a></a>
<P>Fig. 5. Schematic representation of the warehouse structure</I></FONT>.</P>

<P>This design approach is gaining currency because it helps to reduce the complexity of client applications, and to insulate them from changes to databases. An application server also allows  for safe concurrent access by multiple users (e.g., locking to prevent "dirty writes", and can provide a single, unified point of access to multiple databases. The NCGR Data Object Layer (DOL) is a library of software designed to serve as a convenient means for coupling object-oriented applications with a variety of database management systems. Use of object-oriented techniques will facilitate the integration of complex data types and relationships found in biology, which are constantly undergoing evolution. It will also allow encapsulation of database-related tasks inside a single class hierarchy, which can easily be extended (using inheritance) to support new and different database management systems. In theory, these DBMSs may be relational, object-oriented ACEDBs, flat file-based, or of any other design. Applications that use the DOL are insulated from the particulars of DBMSs, which are considered abstractly as "persistence mechanisms". The DOL allows access to multiple heterogeneous persistence mechanisms, and would enable us to "swap out" one such mechanism for another, should we eventually desire to do so. It effectively allows access to the power of an industry-standard DBMS, without locking us into any particular vendor. The NCGR DOL exists, and is already in use with two software applications (<a href="http://www.ncgr.org/gsdb/sv/">GSDB <I>Sequence Viewer</I></a> and the <a href="http://www.ncgr.org/research/pathdb/"><I>PathDB</I></a> for the metabolic pathway database).</P>
<P>The central "brain" of the proposed system is the application server, which will accept and process requests for data from a variety of different clients. These clients may include simple HTML web browsers (via CGI calls to the web server), Java-enabled browsers (via Java applets), and eventually, more sophisticated applications (probably implemented using Java, for platform-independence). The application server also will be accessible to applications, applets, and CGI scripts developed by other groups, thus facilitating the integration of TAIR into the larger community. Client-side software will communicate with the application server using the Object Management Group's (<a href="http://www.omg.org/">OMG</a>) Common Object Request Broker Architecture (<a href="http://www.corba.org/">CORBA</a>), a standard for platform- and language-independent distributed object computing. Communication will occur through an interface that is expressed in terms of biologically-based objects, such as </P>
<P>physical maps, genes, expression experiments, and phenotypes, rather than in terms of database entities. When a request comes to TAIR, the server will respond by creating a network of related objects to satisfy it. When a request involves accessing the TAIR database, the server will populate its objects by sending a request to the underlying Sybase database, via the DOL (with a Sybase database, this communication ultimately occurs in the form of SQL, which is embedded in JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity) calls). The interface to the application server will be compatible with the standards due for adoption by the <a href = "http://www.omg.org/homepages/lsr">Life Sciences Task Force of the OMG</a>, in order to facilitate usage of the TAIR application server by other groups. Adherence to these standards will also facilitate usage of client-side tools developed for TAIR with servers created by other groups. NCGR is a member of the OMG.
<P>The functionality of the application server extends beyond data retrieval to controlling data input to the database as well. The object-oriented curation tools to be developed at NCGR will aid Carnegie curators by facilitating the correct linkages from newly entered data to existing ones. <P>NCGR's state-of-the-art hardware and networking resources will ensure that the system is reliable and performs well. Internet access will occur via a T3 connection with a redundant network topology (a single point of breakage would not prevent access). The web server and application server will run on a 4-CPU Sun Enterprise-3000 server. This server, as well as the FTP site for downloading bulk data files and the proxy servers to allow Stanford curators SQL access to the database, will reside in the "de-militarized zone" outside of NCGR's firewall. All other components of TAIR will be protected by the NCGR firewall. The database server will be amply powered by NCGR's 64-CPU Sun Enterprise-10000 "Starfire" server.

<P><A name ="da"><b>DATA ACQUISITION</B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>We envision five routes for new data to enter TAIR after the initial transfer of AtDB data. These are: (i) computer-assisted entry by curators from journals or other publications, (ii) import from other databases, (iii) synthesis of new information such as by sequence analysis programs, (iv) annotation of information by curators, and (v) user submissions.
<P>There are two distinct kinds of information produced by the community: large datasets such as those produced by whole genome mapping and sequencing projects, and small datasets that are typically the basis for a conventional research publication. The history of the earlier versions of the Arabidopsis database and other model-organism databases indicates that acquisition of large datasets is not generally problematic. The many groups that have produced large amounts of map or sequence information have been forthcoming and helpful in making their data available in a format that facilitates transfer into public databases such as AtDB and we do not envision that any change in procedures will be required as TAIR replaces AtDB. When the curators or advisors of TAIR become aware of a major dataset, one of the curators from Carnegie will contact the people producing the data to discuss the ways in which the data can be incorporated into TAIR. Similarly, acquisition of data from experiments on gene chips/arrays and other high-throughput assays is expected to be relatively straightforward.</P>
<P>By contrast, acquisition of the small datasets will require direct curation by the curators at Carnegie. In some cases, this will involve direct contact with the researcher, or form-based user submissions. However, the overwhelming mass of information that will eventually constitute the heart of TAIR, will come from curatorial extraction of information from publications.</P>
<P>The Arabidopsis community is currently producing approximately 1200 research papers each year, a number that can only increase in the foreseeable future. The main <I>modus operandi</I> of TAIR in the first few years will be that the Carnegie curators will screen each Arabidopsis publication for all suitable data and enter them into TAIR, in a process described below. This approach is being successfully used by FLYBASE and their curators estimate that one curator can extract all germane information from an average of 25 publications per week (pers. comm.). Therefore, between one and two FTEs will be required to curate the current literature. Each of the scientific journals that publish plant biology will be assigned to one of the curators so that in the aggregate, all journals are being monitored. We will attempt to curate the information from the top twenty journals (based on citation index) within two weeks of publication and all publications within 60 days of publication. </P>
<P>Currently, there are approximately 8900 papers indexed by the BIOSIS database in which the words <I>Arabidopsis</I> or <I>thaliana</I> appear in the title, keywords, subject or abstract fields. We will curate these papers at a rate of approximately 2,200 per year during the last four years of the grant. Thus, at the end of the five-year period, the database will be current with respect to the Arabidopsis literature. This will require two FTEs. </P>
<P>Both the current and retrospective curation will be carried out in the same way. The basic procedure that will be used is as follows:

<P><A name ="ej"><b>Entry from Journals. </B> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a></a><P>
Except for map and sequence data, which is discussed separately below, curators will enter data from papers into forms based on the "Proformae" used by the FLYBASE curator. The Proformae are used to provide a structured mechanism whereby as much data as possible can be extracted from a paper in a defined, logical and efficient manner. Data entered into the forms will be parsed by scripts for error checking and database entry. We propose a two-step process to adapt the approach used by FLYBASE to the best advantage for TAIR.</P>
<P>In the short term, we will begin by revising the FLYBASE Proformae so that the vocabulary becomes appropriate to plants and extends to all relevant aspects of plant biology. This will be a part of TAIR's commitment to the use of controlled vocabulary. The curators will then develop temporary forms using Microsoft ACCESS. This is an easy-to-use, readily available database tool, that includes a feature for form production and editing. These temporary forms will be continually updated and refined by the curators while curating a set of 100 papers chosen to represent all types of data. </P>
<P>We expect that the adaptation of the FLYBASE forms and creation of ACCESS forms satisfactory to the curators will take up to six months. At a later stage of this process, the computer scientists at NCGR, in collaboration with the curators, will develop an application that generates a set of production forms for SYBASE, based upon the ACCESS forms. The curators will then use this bespoke application to begin curating the literature in earnest. The ACCESS forms will be retired, having served their function as the quickest and most efficient way for curators to have a curatorial "optical bench" that they can easily modify during what will be a development period of great fluidity and change.</P>
<P>The general architecture of the application for curator literature forms will, as with other aspects of TAIR be three-tier. The front end will be a thin-client (a Java application or applet) that allows the curators to enter and view data. Data entered into the form will be checked "live" by the application before being sent to the application server. The earlier gestation of the forms through ACCESS should result in most errors being caught by the "intelligent" form.</P>
<P>The middle tier will consist of software that serves data to the client for viewing and/or editing. The middle tier will accept edited data from the thin client, possibly do more validation and insert/update it in the database. If the database rejects any of the data, the entire transaction will be rejected and the curator will be notified of the reason and guided to the problem. The form-producing application will be flexible to allow necessary revisions to satisfy the needs of the curators. For added flexibility it will also allow reading and writing of flat-files.</P>
<P>To aid the task of data extraction from journals, the project will first create a complete bibliography (citation plus abstract) of all Arabidopsis-related references in the literature and place these into the database. This should be relatively easy to achieve using a combination of the existing AtDB References (nearly complete up to 1995), PubMed (most plant-related journals are now covered), Agricola and BIOSIS (available over the Web through Stanford's site license as Carnegie lies within Stanford's domain). The bibliography will be kept up-to-date by scripts (to be written) that will regularly access these databases to search for Arabidopsis-related papers, parse the information and place it in the database. If it appears that some Arabidopsis references are being missed, other indexing organizations, such as Cambridge Abstracts will be approached.</P>
<P>To speed curation of the literature -- by allowing searching, cut and paste, and hotlinks -- the project will attempt to obtain full-text of articles for internal (curator) use only and store these in the database. Where this is not possible, web links to electronic journals will be used. In this respect, Stanford's Highwire Press does the web publishing for many Arabidopsis-related journals and has full-text archives going back for many years. In addition, OVID, available through the stanford.edu domain, has simultaneous full-text searching of many other journals, including those from commercial publishing houses such as Nature.</P>
<P>For literature searches by <I>users</I>, we envisage that the bibliography and the full-text of journals in TAIR's database will be searched, but the "hits" will only show the citation and abstract where free access to full text is not provided by the relevant journal. In all cases a link to the journal's web site will be provided. Preliminary tests by the AtDB curators have shown that full-text searching reveals pertinent articles that are missed when only the abstracts and keywords are searched.</P>
<B><I>

<P><A name ="dbi">Database Import. </B></I></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>An important aspect of TAIR is that it should link to or incorporate relevant data from other databases. Sources and kinds of these data will include: GenBank, GSDB, TIGR annotation, Stock Centers, Minnesota EST's, PubMed, NASC's RI, Meinke's classical and other genetic maps, BAC end sequences, BAC fingerprints from Wash. U., contigs and other physical maps, SSLPs, microarray expression data, promoter/enhancer trap data from Cold Spring Harbor, flanking sequences from insertion sites, translations of all genes, and pathways.</P>
<P>We will use three methods for making this information available through TAIR: (i) simple links to the external databases, (ii) implementation of federated database techniques to enable querying of remote databases through the TAIR query interface, and (iii) actual import of data into TAIR. We anticipate that most of this information will come from import of data from external databases into TAIR. The advantages of this approach include: enabling complex querying capabilities above and beyond simple browsing, no dependence on continuous availability of remote databases, and performance improvement due to locality of data access. Issues involved in this "warehousing" approach to integration are briefly discussed below.</P>
<P>Data in the foreign databases will generally be available in at least one of three ways: through bulk distribution of some form of flat file (e.g. tab-delimited dumps of entire tables, GenBank flat files); through direct database query (e.g. SQL); or through "middleware" access to the database. For any of these methods, time and care will be taken to map the data model of the foreign database onto the data model used by TAIR. This will be an ongoing task, particularly when changes to the data model on either side are frequent. An important issue that will be addressed is to identify the subset of the data in the foreign database that is new or modified (or has been deleted) since the last synchronization. Some databases, e.g. GenBank, publish incremental updates, while others may supply mechanisms for querying, based on timestamps. When no such mechanism exists, provision will be made to handle the entire set of data from the foreign database, taking care not to duplicate any information that has already been received.</P>
<P>We foresee that problems may occur when TAIR curators create references from their own data to data that has been imported from foreign databases, and the latter is subject to revision at the source database in ways that can invalidate the sense of the references. Depending on the nature of the local annotation and the nature of the remote changes, a variety of responses may be appropriate. NCGR has experience in this area of pipeline analysis with its implementation of an automated procedure for importing data from sequence databases into GSDB and for the <I>Phytophthora</I> Genome Initiative (hosted at NCGR). The appropriate resolution of such problems will in general be predicated on the cost of the manual approach versus the reliability of an automated approach, and will usually fall somewhere between the two extremes. </P>

The incorporation and annotation of the genome project data from AGI into TAIR is of the highest priority. The major data classes that will be provided to TAIR by AGI are the full genome sequence and the end sequences of the BAC, P1 and TAC clones that were surveyed or actually sequenced. These data can be downloaded directly from GenBank as BAC or YAC-sized stretches of contiguous sequence. </P>

<P><A name ="ga">Genome Annotation</I>. </B></a> <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P>
Most of the sequencing groups are not able to update their sequence's annotations. Thus a sequence completed last year is likely already missing information. This problem is only partially solved by the TIGR Arabidopsis gene annotation project. We propose build on TIGR's foundation by creating a largely automated analysis process to provide the users an extensive set of information on every region of the genome.  These automatically produced results, which are attributed to the sequence analysis programs, will include frequent searches of sequence similarity and motif and gene finding analyses. This information will be updated by computer-assisted curation. A major part of updating sequence annotation will be curated information for experimental data from literature, including gene nomenclature, gene structure, mutant phenotypes, expression profiles, and literature hyperlinks. Our strategy of combining largely automated annotation and literature curation will be an ongoing and iterative process to improve the knowledge about a gene function. In addition, TAIR will include sequences of significant similarities (defined by a cut-off, such as BLAST's P-value of 10<SUP>-5</SUP>) from other organisms to all Arabidopsis genes.</P>
<P>TAIR will have extensive and frequently updated gene annotation using a variety of programs. DNA sequence will be subjected to prediction of gene elements, comparison to other genomic sequences, and comparison to transcript sequences. Analyses applied to conceptual protein translations will include sequence comparison to other proteins, secondary structure prediction, and finding of motifs or other collective descriptions summarizing conserved regions. Sequence similarity searches will be performed using BLAST.</P>
<P>These programs will be re-run as needed to maintain currency. Gene and secondary-structure predictions, which analyze single sequences, need to be run only once per sequence, unless significant changes are made to the sequence or the program's parameters or algorithms. We are keen to incorporate the improved gene-prediction programs for plant genomes that are becoming available, such as the recently described GeneGenerator program (Kleffe <I>et al.</I>, 1998).
<P>In contrast to the "run once" category of analysis, comparisons between a sequence and a set of sequences or library of motifs could yield new results each time the comparison set receives additions. Such searches will be automated to run them at intervals suited to the frequency of updates of their comparison sets, typically weekly or monthly. To avoid the problem of too many redundant hits, a limit will be set on the number of overlapping similarity relationships to be saved. This limit will use the alignment score to ensure that a new discovery of higher similarity can displace an existing feature of lower similarity. This and the operational definition of overlap will be fine-tuned over time.</P>
<P>We will write parsers to translate gene or protein features predicted from this suite of programs (as well as from GenBank and TIGR annotation) into the appropriate MappableElement (Fig. 2), mapped onto the respective DNA or protein sequences. Each of these objects will also inherit the basic attribution mechanism so that it will be simple to find out what program generated which prediction, when, and with what parameters. </P>
<P>After being translated into various subclasses of MappableElement, these features will be visualized by the TAIR map and sequence viewers. Curators will review such annotations and will be able to suppress spurious results, re-run particular analyses, or provide a summary interpretation that integrates across individual program results. These will be attributed to curators with notes as to their reasoning. We will establish a system of flagging individual elements as curator-reviewed or tentative.

<P><A name ="us"><b>User Submission.</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>The literature curation application (described above) will be modified to make applets that produce forms for direct-submission of data from researchers via the web. These will route the submitted data to a temporary storage bin for revision by curators prior to database update. The experience gained in fashioning forms for the curators will be of considerable benefit for the user-input forms. These will be created for a variety of data types, including primary mapping genetic data and PCR marker data. The first efforts will be directed towards creating an extended replacement for the forms currently used by AtDB to collect data on clones being sequenced by the AGI laboratories. With the current AtDB system, initial details are provided by the AGI labs through direct database update via password-protected web forms. Once the clones are submitted to GenBank, an AtDB Perl script updates size, status, and other features from the GenBank record. The script also searches for AGI clones that may have been missed by the AGI annotators. TAIR's forms will additionally allow both for the inclusion of additional information, notably overlaps with other clones, and for batch submission of information from many clones.</P>
<P>In the long run, we will attempt to facilitate acceptance of a new paradigm in which the principal plant journals will require each author to deposit all data in TAIR at the time a paper is accepted for publication. The editors of Plant Physiology and Plant Cell have expressed support and enthusiasm for the concept and we believe that it may eventually be possible to enlist most of the plant journals. Our specific goals will be to design sufficiently robust and facile web forms so that authors can curate their data at the time of publication, and to design and test procedures by which the database and the editorial staff of the journals can interact with a minimum of effort.

<P><A name ="dbm"><B>DATABASE MANAGEMENT</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P> A wide variety of database systems have been used for biological databases, ranging from flat file-based to relational and object-oriented systems, and from "home-grown" systems such as ACEDB to implementations based on commercial products such as Sybase. While any of these approaches can have merit, there are certain basic requirements for a system like TAIR, such as reliability and concurrency of data storage and retrieval, that are best fulfilled today by an industry standard relational database system. </P>
<P>The transactional model used by these databases not only handles issues relating to concurrent access by multiple users, it is also used to guarantee consistency and recoverability of the data in case of software or hardware failures. Use of full database dumps and incremental transaction log dumps for recovery can be augmented by mirroring of hardware devices used to store data. In addition, it is possible to use replication technologies to maintain "warm standby" servers, synchronized with the primary and immediately ready to handle requests should the primary server fail. </P>
<P>Aside from these fault-tolerant strategies, major RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management System) vendors also provide various security mechanisms for guarding against failures due to misuse (intentional or otherwise) of the system. These include password-protected access to the system, configurable permissions on database objects, monitoring and auditing tools as well as resource usage governors, to prevent individual users from overwhelming the system. </P>
<P>We intend to use Sybase Adaptive Server RDBMS, largely in order to benefit from the "economies of scale" gained from NCGR's use of this system in other projects, diminishing the costs to TAIR for licenses, support and training. The production database will be run on a dedicated domain of a Sun Enterprise 10000 with 12 333MHz CPUs, and 12GB RAM (2GB dedicated for Sybase). If warranted by performance requirements, a separate read-only mirror for public access may be created using Sybase Replication Server (GSDB currently uses this system to diminish locking contention between production tasks such as import and read-only public access). There are many higher-level features that are supported to differing degrees by different vendors, e.g. object-oriented extensions to the relational model, procedural extensions to SQL, design and administrative tools, etc. While some of these are potentially useful in the context of a scientifically-focused database, they have the disadvantage that no real standards exist in these areas, and consequently they are developed to proprietary specifications and often undergo considerable evolution under any given vendor. On the other hand, much of the need for this sort of extended functionality is diminished by the use of a three-tier architecture, in which the "business logic" that these extensions are intended to support at the DBMS level is instead encapsulated in the middle tier's application server. This architecture has the distinct advantage of not tying the system too heavily to any given vendor. 

<P><A name ="dbd"><B>DATABASE DISTRIBUTION</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P>Access to the data in TAIR will be made available to the community over the Internet via, anonymous ftp (File Transfer Protocol), CORBA, Java client applications, and Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, which will be the common route for most users. The TAIR web site will build on the successful aspects of the current AtDB and add new functionality inspired by other leading species-specific databases. Full access will require Java-capable web browsers and we will ensure that access to the database will not require any features of the browsers or Java that has not been publicly available for at least six months. No passwords or other forms of login will be required. However, we will work towards the development of optional user-personalized web interfaces that will require a login. We believe that such interfaces could be useful to users who wish to follow developments concerning certain genes, phenotypes or specific regions of the genome. Logins will also allow users to save sessions between visits to TAIR.</P>
<P>The primary access site in North and South America will be the NCGR server. Because of the wide international distribution of the Arabidopsis research community, we will establish mirror sites in Europe and Japan and possibly elsewhere, depending upon user needs. One mirror site, at NASC in the UK (see letter from Mary Anderson, in <I>Supplementary Documentation</I>) has already been offered and we will identify further suitable sites if the grant is awarded. Mirror sites increase the performance of the system by increasing locality of access and distributing the load over several sites. We envision mirroring of html files and CGI scripts using a mechanism such as rdist for synchronization. Database tables may be mirrored using either simple database dump and load protocols or a more sophisticated replication technology (e.g. Sybase Replication Server) that distributes data on an asynchronous transactional basis. This has many advantages over snapshot-based methods including: (i) no downtime for the mirror while a load is being performed, (ii) latency of data at mirrored site not dependent on frequency of snapshots, and (iii) diminished load on either system.

<P><A name ="dac"><B>DIRECT ACCESS</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P>In addition to providing interface-mediated access to TAIR we will implement mechanisms for data distribution that will allow access to the data in ways not supported by the TAIR interface. The simplest mechanism is that of FTP-downloadable files. Simple tab-delimited copies of the relational tables will be available for uploading, e.g. into client-side spreadsheet programs. Analogously, the results of interesting, but time-consuming, queries could be presented in this format and updated periodically. In particular, it may be useful to make available a file containing all of the translations of the theoretical and experimentally verified open reading frames in the Arabidopsis genome in formats such as FASTA. Further, the results of analyses run at the TAIR site, especially for computer time intensive tasks, could be maintained here. This aspect of the database will evolve with the users needs.</P>
<P>FTP downloading will serve users who want to obtain large quantities of data, or even all data in TAIR, in large files of tables. CORBA will be used for direct computer-to-computer communication from sites employing this powerful communication protocol.</P>
<P>We also intend to provide tools whereby users can submit ad hoc queries to the database (e.g. via SQL) and receive the results in a standard tabular representation (at a minimum). In order for users to get the most out of advanced query options, on-line access will be provided to the necessary documentation including (at least a partial) database schema in the form of an E/R Diagram, which displays detail to the table attribute level, and to the schema's data dictionary for a description of the table attributes.</P>
<P>The ability to ask complex questions not anticipated by other interfaces to the database is relatively simple to provide from a development standpoint. The main difficulty attendant upon such a service is administrative, viz. the adverse effects that very complicated or erroneously formulated queries can have on the performance of the system. This will be addressed using Sybase Adaptive Server's flexible system for imposing limitations on the amount of the server's resources (e.g. CPU, i/o, bandwidth) that a given process or user can consume per session. NCGR has previously implemented a <a href="http://www.ncgr.org/gsdb/adhoc/info.html">rudimentary version</a> of such an interface for its <a href="http://www.ncgr.org/research/sequence/">Genome Sequence DataBase</a>.</P>
<P>In addition to the above technologies, NCGR will be pursuing independent development of Java client applications to provide more dynamic, interactive exploration of data. Various tools in this category will become available over time providing exciting new ways of visualizing TAIR information. Most of these tools will not be funded by the TAIR project, but will be available to the Arabidopsis community via TAIR.

<P><A name ="ard"><B>ASSUMPTION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR DATABASE OPERATION</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P>When the funding for AtDB ends (in August '99), the database will continue to run on the Stanford computer for up to six months, but curation of the existing database will, apart from key datasets outlined below, cease. During this period, Mike Cherry has kindly agreed to maintain (including back ups) the computers that AtDB's database, programs, files and web servers currently use including clone registry for the AGI sequencing groups, and to allow logging on to the system from Carnegie. This should be sufficient time to allow a transition of all data to NCGR. It is thus unlikely that there will be a need to spend resources creating an NCGR mirror site of the current AtDB, although plans to do this, if circumstances change, have been discussed with Dr. Cherry. Before the end of current AtDB funding, the TAIR project and the AtDB programmers will discuss tasks needed to be performed to facilitate a smooth transition. We envision a smooth transition of personnel in which the three existing Stanford curators of AtDB (Seung Yon Rhee, Eva Huala, and Margarita Garc&iacute;a-Hern&aacute;ndez) will physically move to assume new positions in the Carnegie Institution.</P>
<P>The Arabidopsis community has come to rely on the AtDB web pages as a central data warehouse for key datasets. Upon funding, we will immediately assume responsibility for maintaining the web pages as a central resource. Certain tasks will be reinitiated at Carnegie immediately following the start of funding. These largely relate to the keeping up-to-date of information deemed important enough to the community to be kept current without a hiatus:</P>
<I><P>1. Sequences.</I> AtDB has programs that parse GenBank and finds Arabidopsis sequences that are new, changed or have altered annotations. This list is mailed weekly to the Arabidopsis newsgroup. These sequences are also incorporated into the datasets used in item 2. </P>
<I><P>2. BLAST, FASTA and other sequence-analysis tools.</I> The sequence datasets described in item 1 are supplemented with all other public Arabidopsis datasets and all plant sequences in GenBank. These are then made available for searching for users by Web forms running BLAST from Washington University (Altschul <I>et al.</I>, 1990), FASTA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) and bespoke pattern matching and restriction mapping tools developed by AtDB (see http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/seqtools.html.
<P>3. Sequence Map</I>. At the time of writing AtDB is releasing a new display of <a href="/search">Arabidopsis sequence </a>. Superseding the previous AGI display, this shows virtual contigs of all AGI and other 10kb+ Arabidopsis sequences in GenBank and shows the position of genetic markers within the sequence. This is an important resource for the community in providing information as to the progress of sequencing in any given region of interest. Most of this process is performed by scripts, which also add the sequence contigs to AtDB's Unified Map, but some continued curation is necessary for placing markers. </P>
<I><P>4. Genetic Maps</I>. AtDB incorporated the latest version of the Meinke and Lister and Dean genetic maps into its Illustra database and uses the data for its graphical <a href="http://genome-www3.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/chromosomes/">on-the-fly displays</a>. Updates, which occur ever few months, are loaded into the database by AtDB curators using SQL.</P> <P>Items 1, 2, and 3 require scripts and will need to be explained to NCGR personnel to allow them to make any adjustments, should an external change cause them to "break" during the transition. No curation, apart from ensuring that the forms are functioning correctly, will be required for items 1 and 2. Items 3 and 4 will require some curation, but it is expected that the curatorial aspects of the above tasks will take an absolute maximum of half of one FTE during the transition period. It is not planned to update AtDB's physical maps with new contigs during the transition (apart from sequence data, see item 3, above). </P>
<P>The above work will continue until we are ready to release TAIR. The AtDB web site will then be modified so that it directs all traffic to TAIR. The Stanford site will run for one year after that and then we will close it. </P>
<P>During the first six months of the transition the curators and the team at NCGR will work at developing the schema, the browser views, the controlled vocabulary and forms required to curate TAIR. Because of the way in which AtDB has morphed from ACEDB to Illustra and (partially) Oracle, the AtDB curators believe that all the data in AtDB should be dumped out, examined and re-thought and then put into the new schema in Sybase. In short, we propose an almost complete overhaul of AtDB. This requirement, to develop an essentially new database, means that the transition will take place in stages. Certain data types, such as reference and colleague data, can probably be translated into a new Sybase database quickly as they have relatively simple attributes and will not be impinged upon much by the controlled vocabulary that will be developed. Others, especially those related to the curation of the literature, will take longer. </P>
<P>In parallel with creating and populating tables, the development of the associated software required to view these data will take place. The first priority is to reestablish the Unified Physical Map View, which is one of the most completely developed aspects of AtDB. This display is designed to facilitate map-based cloning by displaying graphically the physical maps from many groups and methods in one site. This display, which was released in March 1999, can be found in <a href="http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/maps.html">AtDB's Maps page</a>. </P>
<P>Storage of the data underlying these maps can be implemented in Sybase with relatively little modification. The development of the viewer will provide an ideal testing ground for the interactions between Carnegie curators and NCGR programmers and the pre-existing viewer from AtDB should help considerably in these discussions as it provides a concrete example of the type of end-product required. Having this as the first project will help to build up a framework to approach later and more difficult problems. </P>
<P>Once TAIR's replacement of the Unified Physical Map View with an integrated map view is implemented, we will reinitiate curation of the maps based on large datasets (e.g., from the AGI labs or large mapping efforts and from other databases such as GenBank), but will not initiate curation from the literature until the forms are fully developed. The reason for this is that we do not want to revisit the literature. Thus, we need to have the forms for curation finished before we actually begin this task. Once we have initiated curation of the literature, we will focus on curating the data on gene expression and on integrating the sequence annotation with the integrated Map View. RNA expression data are not currently represented in AtDB and there are no public data available as yet. We anticipate that there will not be significant amounts of data of this type during the first year of the grant so there is adequate time to develop this aspect of the database without serious inconvenience to the community. Because this is a rapidly evolving area, we believe that we will also be able to take advantage of software developed by other groups that is not currently available but is reported to be near completion. 

<P><A name ="qc"><b>QUALITY CONTROL</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a>
<P>There are two main issues in quality control: the consistency of the curators and the competence of the system. We will institute checks on both of these in the following ways.</P>
<P>First, curators will be highly trained biologists, usually with a Ph.D. Curators will work with curation assistants with at least a B.A. in biology. Any new dataset will be tested for consistency using scripts before being loaded into the database. Curators and curation assistants will participate in a weekly lab meeting. In addition to discussing and resolving the issues that have arisen that week, we will implement a lottery system for choosing several records that have been entered recently. These will be reviewed by the entire group with reference to the original dataset or publication. The goal is to impose common standards in curation and to ensure accountability among the staff.</P>
<P>For quality control of the software, any new displays will be checked by the curators, Pis, and advisors, before being released to production. In addition, NCGR performs semi-formal testing of all software that it develops, at the unit and system levels, prior to all releases to the public. It also performs regular, automated regression testing of key components to ensure that bugs are not introduced from one release to the next. NCGR is currently making its testing process more systematic and formalized, as part of an effort to reach level three of the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model (Humphrey <I>et al.</I>, 1999) by the end of the third quarter of 1999.</P>
<P>As a check of the system, the PIs will implement periodic audits of the system. A typical test will be to have a curator enter a dataset into the system and then the PIs will attempt to reconstruct the dataset (e.g. a publication) from a query or series of queries. By comparing the results of the query with the original dataset we should be able to check for errors or missing links and vrelated problems. </P>
<P>In addition, the project staff will conduct regular examinations of the pattern of usage of TAIR's web site use in order to identify where user navigation could be improved by, for example, providing a direct link between two pages where the user previously had to go via an intermediate page. Initially, software such as wusage (currently used by AtDB) could be used. This provides document trails and example visits showing how long a user visits the site and where they went. Once TAIR is set up for registered users (who use a login) a more extensive analysis could be conducted.</P>
<P>Finally, we expect that the community of plant biologists will be a huge audit committee that will identify any errors. We will ensure that it is easy for any user to comment on any piece of data or the operation of the system.

<P><A name ="man"><b>MANAGEMENT</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P>TAIR will primarily involve two sites, the Carnegie and NCGR. Carnegie has responsibility for curation and interaction with the plant community, and NCGR has responsibility for providing the physical facilities on which the database will run, and for developing or implementing the computational tools that support the operation of the database. Chris Somerville and Bruno Sobral will be the lead PIs at the two sites.  </P>
<P>The lead PIs will take joint responsibility for overall direction of the project, which will include: recruiting and appointing staff, fiscal responsibility, organizing quality control procedures, and responding to advice and criticisms from the advisory committee. Because of the complementary expertise of the PIs, it is expected that Chris Somerville will take primary responsibility for aspects of the project that deal with biological issues and Bruno Sobral will take primary responsibility for aspects concerning the computational issues.</P>
<P>David Meinke (Oklahoma State University) and Chris Town (Case Western Reserve U.), two colleagues with extensive experience in plant biology will also be directly involved in the management of TAIR. They will serve along with Seung Yon Rhee, Eva Huala, Allan Dickerman, Bruno Sobral and Chris Somerville on the executive committee of TAIR. The role of the executive committee will be to make final decisions concerning the direction and implementation of the project, following community and staff input. In addition, the entire organization will be one in which all staff members play an active role in discussing the issues and setting the goals. We believe that creating TAIR must be a scientifically rewarding endeavor for everyone involved.</P>
<P>Staff positions are proposed for the two main activities according to our analysis of what is required to meet the overall goals of the project.</P>
<P>The Carnegie staff will be composed of six curators, including the four people who are currently producing AtDB. Seung Y. Rhee, the TAIR Director, will be responsible for the day-to-day management, for scheduling and implementing projects between NCGR and Carnegie, and for the biological input into the design of TAIR. Eva Huala, the Head Curator, will be responsible for managing the tasks of the curators. The other curators will share the tasks associated with developing and populating TAIR. Specific responsibilities will be based on the expertise and interests of the various curators. For instance, Eva Huala has extensive research experience in plant developmental biology, and Margarita Garc&iacute;a-Hern&aacute;ndez has expertise in plant molecular and cell biology.<I> </P>
</I><P>The NCGR staff will be led by Allan Dickerman, Computational Biologist, Andrew Farmer, Database Administrator/Software Developer, and Don Kiphart, Software Development Team Leader. Additional members will be appointed, according to the expertise needed, from NCGR's 23 information technology staff. 

<P><A name ="eia"><b>EXTERNAL INPUT/ADVICE</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P>We propose to establish a two-tiered system for obtaining input and advice by inviting colleagues to form two committees with the following makeup.</P>
<I>
<P>Advisory committee</I> </P>
<P>We propose to invite membership on the advisory committee in consultation with NSF and the North American Arabidopsis Steering Committee. Our advisors will be selected for their perspective and scientific maturity, and we are interested in their broad policy advice and in seeking their input on how we can better serve our users. We will attempt to cycle advisors on a 3 year basis. We envision that the advisory committee will meet quarterly by conference call and will meet in person annually at Palo Alto or Santa Fe. In addition, we will have ad hoc meetings at the annual Arabidopsis conference.  A preferred composition of the committee would be:
<ul> 
<li>One individual from the national or international Arabidopsis steering committee (chosen by those committees)
<li> Three members from the Arabidopsis community at large (preferably at least one person with direct involvement in genomics). One non-US member and two US members.
<li> One individual from the general plant community at large, preferably someone with direct involvemnet in genomics
<li>Two individuals with direct experience in managing biological databases. 
<li>One individual with experience in electronic publishing (preferably one of the principals in Highwire Press, a local group of librarians from the Stanford library).
</ul>

<I><P>User committee</I> </P>
<P>The user committee will be composed of 10 students and postdocs at bay area universities (Stanford, Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, Davis, SF State). This group will identify aspects of the database that are difficult to use or fail to meet the needs of the community. It is our observation that postdocs and students are the major users of the databases and that their input about the current state of the database is at least as useful as that from their faculty advisors. We propose to have triannual one-day workshops at Carnegie in which the user committee will meet with the curators to discuss the current operation of the database. The curators will pose questions for the user committee; typical questions will involve one or more of the users demonstrating in real time how they would make a query. We propose to provide nominal compensation to the users for each workshop in which they participate


<P><A name ="oat"><B>OUTREACH AND TRAINING</B></a>  <A href ="#top"><A href ="#top">Go to top </a><P>We will provide user support in several ways:</P>
<I><P>Documentation</I>. Highly detailed documentation explaining the public views of the database will be available on line. We will attempt to duplicate the excellent level of explanation available for FLYBASE. We believe this will be particularly useful for the developers of other plant databases.</P>
<I><P>e-mail inquiries.</I> Each page of the web interface will have a link for questions to the curators at Carnegie, who will endeavor to answer queries immediately. The head curator will establish procedures for delegating queries to the entire curatorial staff. </P>
<I><P>In-person support. </I>The senior curators will present talks at national and international meetings. Hands-on workshops will be offered at major national and international plant biology meetings. We expect that the level of training by this route will be similar to that conducted by the current AtDB staff.</P>
<I><P>Announcements and publications. </I>The Arabidopsis newsgroup (arab-gen@net.bio.net) will be used to post announcements of interest to the community. As was the case with AtDB, the curators will also publish articles concerning the design and operation of the database and related information resources (e.g. see Flanders <I>et al.</I>, 1998; Meinke <I>et al.</I>, 1998; Rhee <I>et al.</I>, 1999).
<P>In addition we will provide training in the following ways:</P>
<I><P>Visiting appointments.</I> Students, postdocs and visiting faculty who wish to enhance their ability to develop or exploit bioinformatics tools to ask new questions about the Arabidopsis dataset or related datasets, will be offered visiting appointments at the Carnegie Institution or at NCGR (without any offer of financial support from TAIR). Individuals who wish to develop new bioinformatics tools will normally reside at NCGR, while those who wish to develop new methods of querying the data will normally reside at the Carnegie or at NCGR (or both) and would normally be advised by one of the people listed in this proposal. AtDB has hosted a number of visitors and we forecast that the number of visitors will greatly expand as the size and complexity of the dataset expands.</P>
<I><P>Education</I>. NCGR engages in opportunities to integrate research and education, and in the process to increase participation of underrepresented groups. NCGR helps train young scientists at the college and high school levels, primarily through two outlets:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. Training graduate and undergraduate students in informatics.</I> Training of students in bioinformatics is performed by Bruno Sobral, who is an adjunct professor at New Mexico State University (NMSU) in Molecular Biology and the University of New Mexico (UNM) in Biology, in addition to his position at NCGR. Programs at NMSU are geared toward underrepresented groups, particularly Hispanic and Native American students. Skilled bioinformaticists are in high demand, and NCGR hopes its involvement with NMSU students will foster their interest in bioinformatics careers.</P>
<I><P>2. Outreach</I>. NCGR conducts an outreach program for Northern New Mexico high school students, introducing them to genetics and bioinformatics. This program is geared to under-served biology classes around Santa Fe and reached about 200 students last academic year. The goal is to stimulate interest in science and technology as a pursuit in college and beyond  among the students.
<P>In addition, NCGR has begun a sabbatical program for visiting scientists and has plans to institute a post-doc fellowship program in 1999. The first scientist in the sabbatical program was Nevin Young of the University of Minnesota, who visited NCGR in 1998 and worked with staff members to develop a prototype of the Plant Disease Resistance Genes Database (R-Genes).</P>
<P>NCGR is committed to increasing its role in training in bioinformatics. Future possibilities currently under discussion are a collaborative program for bioinformatics training for students at New Mexico Tech (Socorro NM), a bioinformatics training course for Latin American students at the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT, Cali), and a joint bioinformatics training course with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories. NCGR expects that with new senior hires in its scientific programs, other NCGR staff will likely obtain adjunct appointment at state universities, thus increasing the training of graduate and undergraduate students in bioinformatics.
