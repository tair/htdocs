Foreword to the Report</H2></b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the discovery of the structure of DNA, the field of biology has experienced a series of revolutionary changes in the ways in which problems are approached.  The recent development of high capacity methods for analyzing the structure and function of genes, which may be collectively termed &quot;genomics&quot;, represents a new paradigm with broad implications for biologists. Instead of characterizing genes one or a few at a time, it is now possible to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of all of the genes in an organism and to measure the amount of mRNA corresponding to all of the genes.  Although comprehensive information of this kind is currently available for only a few organisms, it seems likely that comparable levels of information will rapidly become available for most widely studied organisms, including several higher plants. Access to this information, and new tools that exploit it, will profoundly alter the ways in which biologists select and approach questions.  This, in turn, will directly impact the application of directed genetic methods to the improvement of economically important plants.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Although future developments in a rapidly emerging field can be difficult to predict, some projection of trajectory can be helpful in planning for the development of community resources and other initiatives that may facilitate progress.  Indeed, the success of the <I>Arabidopsis</I> genome project stands as an example of productive foresight.  Now that the sequence of <I>Arabidopsis</I> is nearing completion, it was deemed useful to reinitiate the process that led to the formulation of the original vision of the project (NSF document 90-80).   Toward this end a group of plant biologists (Appendix I) met to discuss the subject at an NSF-sponsored workshop "New Directions in Plant Biological Research" held on November 23 &amp; 24 1998 at the Carnegie Institution of Plant Biology, Stanford University. This document summarizes the perspectives that emerged from these discussions and presents the views/vision of a diverse group of plant scientists. The report also including input from the North American <I>Arabidopsis</I> Steering Committee (NAASC) as well as from the plant biology community at large.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><H2><a name="report">I. INTRODUCTION</a></H2>
<H2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Plant Genomics: Early Lessons from the <I>Arabidopsis</I> Genome Sequence</B> </H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Plant biologists have been at the forefront of the shift to genomics.  As a result, one of the first eukaryotic organisms to be completely sequenced will be the small mustard species <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I> (Meinke et al., Science 1998, 282:662).  Because of certain technical advantages, including a highly compact genome of about 130 Mb with little interspersed repetitive DNA,<I> Arabidopsis</I> is one of the most widely used model organisms for studying the biology of higher plants. It is also close relative of many food plants such as canola, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, turnip, rutabaga, kale, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and radish. More importantly, <I>Arabidopsis</I> genome sequence information will be applicable to major crops including corn and soybeans, because of the close evolutionary similarities among the genomes of all flowering plants. An international consortium called The <I>Arabidopsis</I> Genome Initiative (AGI), which includes six research groups in Japan, Europe and the USA are collaborating to sequence of the genome. About 50% of the genome sequence is currently available in public databases and a large proportion of the genes are also represented by partial cDNA sequences.  It is currently anticipated that the complete genome sequence will be available by the end of the year 2000.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The results to date of the <I>Arabidopsis</I> Genome Initiative have revealed a new world of scientific processes and opportunities in plants.  With greater than one-third of the genome sequence finished, completely unanticipated functions have been found.  These recent findings reveal our present ignorance of the mechanisms by which plants grow and function, but also provide the exact experimental material necessary to gain a new understanding: the genes mediating the newly discovered processes.  New technical capabilities such as gene chips and gene replacement technologies now, for the first time, allow us to proceed rapidly and surely from gene sequence to function. Thus, there is an unprecedented opportunity to follow up on these recent genomic discoveries by learning the functions of all plant genes, to reveal the previously unknown processes that are fundamental to the mechanisms of plant life. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent unexpected discoveries derived from genomic sequence information including the identification of:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1)</B> <B>Glutamate receptor genes.</B>  Glutamate receptors are components of neurons, where they serve as ion channels in rapid synaptic transmission.  Recently two glutamate receptor genes have been found in <I>Arabidopsis</I>, each encoding proteins with all of the signature domains of the animal proteins.  What role could such previously brain-specific proteins play in plants?  Use of channel inhibitors shows that blocking the plant channels seems to affect the ability of the plants to perceive light.  What role do the channels play?  Several glutamate channel blockers used in brain research derive from plants; they were previously considered to be used in defense against herbivores.  Now it appears that these compounds may function in plants to regulate plant channels.  How many other bioactive plant compounds, such as caffeine or nicotine, have direct roles in plants?  What are the roles?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2)</B> <B>Receptor kinases.</B>  The <I>Arabidopsis</I> genome sequences to date reveal nearly 100 different genes that appear to code for transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases, implying that the complete genome will have on the order of 300 such genes.  The mutant phenotype of only three is known; two are involved in regulation of cell division and differentiation in meristems, and one appears to be a hormone receptor.  A similar gene in rice mediates response to a bacterial pathogen.  What are the roles of the hundreds of these proteins?  Their existence implies a massive network of cell-cell and environment-plant communication, via a series of ligands yet to be discovered.  Understanding this network will give us an entirely new view of plant development, environmental response, and organismal integration.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3)</B> <B>Nuclear architecture.</B>  Use of modern imaging technologies with nuclear proteins (such as photoreceptors and transcription factors) discovered in <I>Arabidopsis</I> reveals a series of striking and novel subnuclear localization patterns.  What are the nuclear microcompartments that have been revealed, and what is their role in gene expression and genomic function?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4)</B> <B>Multiple drug resistance ABC transporter genes.</B>  There are on the order of 50 genes coding for ABC transporters already found in the <I>Arabidopsis</I> genome project and thus, 150 are expected in the complete genome.  What do they transport?  Some appear to be mitochondrial.  What is the nature of this mitochondrial traffic, and the role it plays in nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction and energy metabolism?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5) G-protein coupled receptors.</B>  It appears that there are already many candidate genes that could code for 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors in <I>Arabidopsis</I>.  There is, however, only a single known heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit.  Do all of the putative receptors act through a single G-protein, or do these plant receptors act in an entirely new signal transduction pathway, different from the pathway in which the cognate animal proteins acts?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6)</B> <B>Blue light photoreceptors. </B>One indication of the amazing degree of conservation in biological systems is the discovery of molecules in plants that are important in human disease. For example, the conserved role of the blue light photoreceptors cryptochrome in regulating both circadian plant growth and rhythmic sleep behavior in animals.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These unanticipated discoveries have opened a new world of experimentation and understanding that we must explore now. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><H2>II. Functional and Integrative Genomics: The Next Decade of Plant Research</H2>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The goal of the field is to understand plant biology completely. In particular, this means being able to explain in detail how all aspects of plant growth and development occur, how plants respond to change in their environment, the molecular basis of variation between species and how plants respond in complex communities (ie., ecosystems).  As integral part of this goal is to make the knowledge broadly accessible.  In this respect our traditions for organizing academic knowledge are no longer appropriate to the task and will be even less so in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In order to progress toward that goal in the most efficient manner we need to have a sense of what kinds of discoveries are likely to be most useful so that we can allocate resources and make the many community decisions that shape modern science on a daily basis.  It is also essential to identify the factors that will facilitate broad progress in understanding plant biology rather than only focusing on one or two model species.  The biomedical community is largely focused on one organism and is not a good model for how plant biology should develop.  The completion of the goals for plant biology described in our mission statement will enable dramatic increases in our understanding of mechanistic aspects of plant gene function.&#9;</P>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assigning Functions to All Plant Genes.</B></I></FONT>An important and revolutionary aspect of the proposal <I>to understand the function of all plant genes by the year 2010 </I>- is that it implicitly endorses the allocation of resources to attempts to assign function to genes that have no known function.  This represents a significant departure from the common practice of defining and justifying a scientific goal based on the biological phenomena.  The rationale for endorsing this radical change is that for the first time it is feasible to envision a whole system approach to function.  This whole system approach promises to be orders of magnitude more efficient than the conventional approach.  We envision that once the efficiencies of genomics have been realized, presumably within the next decade, there will be a renewed emphasis on problem-oriented approaches and an expanded emphasis on understanding diversity. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to attain this level of understanding, a set of scientific problem-oriented goals were defined.  The attainment of these goals relies heavily upon the development of a set of process-oriented, enabling technologies (tools and materials) and on further human resource development in the plant sciences.</P>
</FONT><B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A. Scientific Problem-Oriented Goals.</B></I> The natural world provides a virtually endless source of biological phenomena that are amenable to description and explanation.  However, experience suggests that certain problems yield insights of broad relevance whereas others do not.  What are the problems that are likely to yield the greatest advances? </P>

<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B. Process-Oriented Goals:</B></I>For biologists to fully realize the benefit from the availability of fully sequenced plant genomes, we must facilitate a dramatic change in the current laboratory landscape.  Current studies of single genes will transition to large-scale analysis of entire gene regulatory networks.  Moreover, with the expected further reduction in the cost of DNA sequencing technologies, comparisons of a few genomes will be replaced by a broad sampling of plant genetic diversity.  Ultimately, the future plant biologist will be integrating an array of tools that will allow an appreciation of the complexity which we can currently only imagine.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;The proposal made about ten years ago to sequence the <I>Arabidopsis</I> genome was a process goal.  It was based on the concept that it would be tremendously enabling for the entire community to have the complete sequence of the <I>Arabidopsis</I> genome.  </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- <I>To assign a function to all higher plant genes on the basis of experimental evidence by 2010.</B></I>  An implicit assumption is that higher plants share essentially the same basic set of genes and that by knowing the function of a small number of representatives, it will be possible to infer the probable function in other species.  We recognize that in many cases, the exact function of many genes will remain elusive beyond the year 2010.  However, we believe that it will be possible to experimentally assign a general function to each gene in the genome of the model organisms or to establish that inactivation or overexpresion of the gene causes no observable effect on the organism.  In order to establish gene function, we believe that, at the very least, each gene must be characterized with respect to the phenotypes cased by inactivation or overexpression, the mode and specificity of regulation, the subcellular localization of the gene product, the identity of interacting proteins and the identity of coregulated genes.    By extending the goal to include all higher plants, we intend that research on diversity of gene function must play an increasingly important role.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recognized that the community will never assemble these tools unless concerted efforts are made.  Large consortia of investigators working on each of these topics, independently of their application, will need to be established.  While this is perhaps not the most immediate creative science, the benefits to overall progress clearly justifies the investment of resources.  Directed assembly of these tools will prevent the counterproductive &quot;reinvention of the wheel&quot; by all independent labs wishing to utilize these new technologies.  Independent investigators will then be able to focus their efforts on the biological questions at hand.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key concept for all these methods/tools is access. Access to all these tools must include means of dissemination of appropriate arrays, resources for their use, and means of storing and accessing data generated by their use.<B> </B>The investment in their development will only be worthwhile if it includes establishment of effective mechanisms for ensuring the methods and data will be available to the entire biology research community.  The mechanisms for rapid dissemination of information developed by the U. S. component of the <I>Arabidopsis</I> Genome Initiative, whereby even preliminary genome sequence data is rapidly disseminated, should serve as a model for this.  Under no circumstances should consortia be established under conditions where non-members would be excluded from immediate access/utilization of the products of the consortia.  Efforts to assemble these tools need to be established as soon as possible. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is expected that the application of these and related methods will lead to the assignment of some degree of gene function to most higher plant genes.  In addition, parallel studies of the function of all genes in the other, non plant, model organisms will contribute a great deal to understanding gene function.  Presumably, this comprehensive approach to understanding gene function will usher in an era of true genetic engineering in which rational changes can be devised from some level of knowledge of the entire system, rather than the one-gene tinkering that has marked the beginning of the era.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">III. Human Resource Development.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The availability of massive quantities of plant genome sequence data plus an increasing understanding of plant gene function will bring about rapid changes in all areas of plant biology, from biochemistry and molecular biology to ecology and evolution.  Advances in these areas of basic plant biology will be rapidly transformed into practical benefits that will change the face of agriculture and will trigger rapid growth in the agriculturally related biotechnology industry.  These anticipated advances will require a new generation of basic and applied plant biologists who possess new combinations of skills, both among college graduates and among those who pursue more advanced training.   Providing these highly skilled plant scientists will require the coordinated efforts of colleges, universities, and federal funding agencies, with appropriate support from the private sector and professional societies.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important characteristic of the new generation of plant scientists is that they will need to be broadly trained in plant biology.  Regardless of whether they are biochemists or ecologists, they will need to have basic training in all areas of plant biology and must be able to work as effective members of multi disciplinary teams. Although a solid foundation in biology will be the most important requirement, the next generation of plant scientists will also need to be highly skilled in a wide array of genomic techniques including the ability to use computers to access and analyze large quantities of biological data.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the training of future plant biologists will occur primarily in colleges and universities, federal funding agencies will be important partners in this effort.  New training programs are needed at all levels; i.e. baccalaureate, MS, Ph.D., and post-doctoral.  New interdisciplinary training programs at the undergraduate level will require changes in the curriculum requirements in many traditional majors.  At the graduate and postdoctoral levels, new and expanded financial support mechanisms are needed.   Funding for graduate students and postdoctoral associates has traditionally been tied to individual research grants, which often limits the training possibilities available to the trainees.  New funding mechanisms, including both expanded training grants and fellowships to individual students, are needed.  These mechanisms should provide trainees with a maximum of flexibility to pursue their training in top quality labs and to gain the various experiences and expertise needed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Training Goals:</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Establish new individual predoctoral and postdoctoral fellowship programs in plant biology. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expand existing training grant programs, with a focus on high quality programs that provide multi disciplinary training experiences for both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees in plant biology.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IV. Benefits of the Research.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The availability of the sequence of <I>Arabidopsis</I>, together with the comprehensive data sets and tools outlined above will not only dramatically accelerate research on this species, but also will facilitate studies on other plants and higher eukaryotes.  As noted above, the availability of a comprehensive set of gene knockouts can be used to make rapid progress on analysis of gene function for currently &quot;unknown&quot; genes.  The majority of such genes are common to all plants, and a large fraction are common to all higher eukaryotes.  Thus, much of the work on <I>Arabidopsis</I> will be directly applicable to these other systems, and <I>Arabidopsis</I> will be the system of choice for answering many questions on gene function.  In addition, syntenic relationships are already being established between the chromosomes of <I>Arabidopsis</I> and a variety of crop species.  Exploitation of these relationships will dramatically facilitate molecular identification of genes associated with specific desirable traits in crops.  The perceived viability of this approach is clearly evidenced by the significant investment of the private sector in <I>Arabidopsis</I>/crop comparative genomics.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the biochemical and cell biological side, proteomics tools will enable rapid identification of proteins from very small samples.  This will engender a resurgence in biochemical approaches to biological questions.  Small-scale protein purification and determination of the nature of the protein will be a routine method of gene identification.  Obtaining and examining the knockouts of the identified genes will immediately lead to further characterization of biological function.  Similarly, partners of proteins, or other components of protein complexes will be more easily identified and analyzed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the genetic side, isolation of genes and understanding their molecular/biochemical function will no longer be a bottleneck. For example, allowing the immediate ability to compare sequence similarities between members of  gene families. This will lead to a renewed focus on genetic screens &quot;rational genetics&quot;- aimed at understanding gene function at a tissue or organismal level.  Researchers will be able to afford to invest more time on relatively complex screens, including those that might yield a lot of "false hits".  They will be able to afford to discard many of the mutants coming from these screens because of the ease of isolation and analysis.  Genetic screens are still one of the most effective tools to identify gene function, even in the age of cDNA arrays, and are unlikely to be superseded soon by <I>in silico</I> analyses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to analysis of small sets of genes or proteins, genome-wide analysis will be enabled.  For example, such approaches have already led to identification of new, previously undetected regulatory sequences in yeast.  The ability to simultaneously study regulation of whole sets of genes, or even of all genes, will enable unprecedented insight into complex biological processes.  If properly implemented, it should be possible to assemble a database of expression profiles of each condition, as it is determined.  Other researchers could draw on and add to this database as they perform their own analysis.  This should form the basis of a comprehensive map of regulation of genes during development and in response to environmental conditions.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;In the long term, such a database could be integrated with the growing body of biological information on gene function, plant form and plant biochemistry.  The eventual goal would be assembly of a virtual plant, click on a leaf at three days of age and get a list of all genes up-regulated in a variety of physiological conditions; click on a root and watch it grow with a dynamic list of changes at the molecular level accessible.  Thus, the data would be accessible to all researchers in an easily utilized form.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development and application of genome sequences and enabling technologies will lead to the removal of a series roadblocks to progress, putting the answers to all of these questions in reach.<B> </B>For example, genomic technology will enable the discovery of:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-rapid characterization and managing germplasm resources</P></dir></dir>
  
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ability to study gene expression and genetic function in parallel for multiple genes, networks, and their products will revolutionize mechanistic approaches to plant physiology. Understanding the plant genome structure will enable mechanistic dissection of chromosomal biology, including  the assembly of complete, interacting pathways for biosynthesis of novel compounds, and will allow whole genome analysis of epigenetic mechanisms and their relationship to genome organization and  combinatorial approaches to genetic analysis via functional libraries </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Rapid methods for comprehensive analysis of coordinated regulation of gene expression will enable new means of discovery of gene function  through rapid analysis of mutants, as moving to a gene will no longer be a bottleneck.. Moreover, these tools will allow testing of models of functions of single genes, and even construction and reintroduction of novel assemblies of multiple genes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">V. Application of the Intellectual Advances: Potential Benefit to      </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">     Applied Science</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A. Molecular Analysis of Traits. </B></I>Molecular genetics has to this point been dominated by the identification of single genes that control phenotypes of interest.  However, this approach is of limited value in understanding the molecular basis for complex phenotypes that are complicated integrals of the action of many genes.  For instance, yield, although exceedingly important, is relatively undefined at the biochemical and physiological level.  This lack of definition stems not only from the complexity of the phenotype, but also from the limited number of specific biochemical or physiological measurements that can be made.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The identification of every gene in a particular plant species gives the possibility to analyze expression of each gene in particular varieties or genotypes, in different environments, and in response to various stresses.  In addition, modern chromatographic methods, coupled with on-line detection by mass spectrometry, are allowing the resolution of increasingly complex mixtures of small molecules and proteins.  As a result of these parallel developments, the assignment of surrogate end-points for detecting complex phenotypes will become increasingly commonplace and facile.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Understanding patterns of gene regulation will directly lead to the ability to express genes at appropriate places and times in development or in response to specific extra-organismal cues.  This knowledge will be applicable to genes engineered into plants from any source, including those outside the plant kingdom.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result of understanding how complex properties are regulated will be an ability to breed crops that are improvements of current varieties, as well as new crops that make altered amounts or types of certain components of that crop, s output (<I>e.g.</I> starch, oil ,protein).  Moreover, the ability to precisely control gene expression and redirect metabolic output will make possible the production of novel materials in plants at economically attractive levels.  </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B. Molecular Breeding. </B></I>As the resolution of genetic maps in the major crops increases, and as the molecular basis for specific traits or physiological responses becomes better elucidated, it will be increasingly possible to associate candidate genes, discovered in model species, with corresponding loci in crop plants.  Appropriate relational databases will make it possible to freely associate across genomes with respect to gene sequence, putative function, or genetic map position. Once such tools have been implemented, the distinction between quantitative genetics (breeding) and molecular genetics will become blurred.  Breeders will routinely use computer models to formulate predictive hypotheses to create phenotypes of interest from complex allele combinations, and then construct those combinations by scoring large populations for very large numbers of genetic markers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vast resource comprising breeding knowledge gathered over the last several decades will become directly linked to basic plant biology, and enhance the ability to elucidate gene function in model organisms.  For instance, traits that are poorly defined at the biochemical level but well established as a visible phenotype can be associated by high resolution mapping with candidate genes.  Orthologous genes in a model species, such as <I>Arabidopsis</I> or rice, may not have a known association with a quantitative trait like that seen in the crop, but might have been implicated in a particular pathway or signaling chain by genetic or biochemical experiments.  This kind of cross-genome referencing will lead to a convergence of economically relevant breeding information with basic molecular genetic information. The specific phenotypes of commercial interest that we expect to be dramatically improved by these advances include both the improvement of factors that traditional limit agronomic performance (input traits) and the alteration of the amount and kinds of materials that crops produce (output traits).  Examples include:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<DIR><DIR>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-abiotic stress tolerance (cold, drought, salt)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-biotic stress tolerance (fungal, bacterial, viral, chewing and sucking insect feeding)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-nutrient use efficiency (N,P,K)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-manipulation of plant architecture and development (size, organ shape, number,  and position, timing of development, senescence)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">-metabolite partitioning (redirecting of carbon flow among existing pathways, or shunting into new pathways) </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C. Rational Plant Improvement. </B></I>The implications of genomics with respect to food, feed and fibre production can be envisioned on many fronts.  At the most fundamental level, the advances in genomics will greatly accelerate the acquisition of knowledge and that, in turn, will directly impact many aspects of the processes associated with plant improvement.  Knowledge of the function of all plant genes, in conjunction with the further development of tools for modifying and interrogating genomes, will lead to the development of a genuine genetic engineering paradigm in which rational changes can be designed and modeled from first principles.  </P>
